Scripts for PhD submission (Brendan Swain, University of Cambridge)

The scripts and data here were used to write "Chapter 5: Investigating the expression of ABCG2 in human embryonic stem cells".
Raw counts data and a combined table of phenotypic data from ArrayExpress accession E-MTAB-6819 are present in the "/data/" directory. The scripts are numbered according to the order in which they were run, and named according to their purpose.

Within the scripts, code contributing to a specific figure in the dissertation are labelled.
